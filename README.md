# ODE

Digital Electronics Course Project

## Getting Started

Implementation of a serial communication between a computer and a microcontroller. Message (formatted as Sx<CR><LF>) defines
which diode and potentiometer are active. The (digital) value  from an active potentiometer is read and then written to
a 4-pack 7-segment display (0-4095, max 4 digits), and then scaled to a 0-100 range. New-scaled value defines how bright will active
diode shine.

## Prerequisites

For testing purposes the RS_MSP430F5438A is needed.
