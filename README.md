# ODE

Implementation of a serial communication between a computer and a microcontroller. Message (formatted as Sx<CR><LF>) defines
number of diode and potentiometer which are active. The (digital) value  from an active potentiometer is read and then written to
a 4-pack 7-segment display (0-4095, max 4 digits), and then scaled to a 0-100 range. New-scaled value defines how bright will active
diode shine.
